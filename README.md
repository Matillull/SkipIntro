In order to run this code, you must have Selenium and Python installed.
These are the versions that I have on my PC:

Selenium: Version 4.23.1
Python 3.12.2
You can check the versions by typing pip show selenium and python --version in the terminal.

I am currently working on this code. The auto full screen feature is not working yet, but you can do it manually.

In the script, you must paste a link to the chapter you want to watch on animeflv.net (by default, it’s set to Cap 1 of Death Note).

How to use: As soon as you run the code, it will open Brave (I prefer using Brave because of the ads; if you want to use Chrome, change it in the script).
The script will then select the video server SW (Stream Wish), click Play automatically. You must wait for the opening to start, and then PRESS TAB to skip. After pressing TAB, if you press it again, it won’t work for that URL. When you move to the next episode and select SW (Stream Wish) again, you will be able to skip the intro by pressing TAB.


Note: If you wait too long after the opening has started the video will fast-forward more than desired.
The script advances a fixed amount of 85 seconds, with a 5-second margin from the start of the opening. This means that if you delay too long, the script may skip too far ahead.


Thank you for reading and ENJOY IT. If you want to make a pull request with a new or updated feature, I’m open to reviewing it.
